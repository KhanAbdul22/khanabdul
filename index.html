      <a id="deliverables" class="anchor" href="/buffy/proposal#deliverables" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Deliverables</h2>

    <p>Designs for the following pages and sections:</p>

    <ul class="task-list">
      <li>Global navigation and Footer</li>
      <li>Homepage</li>
      <li>Article page layouts (2) with various styles</li>
      <li>Category page (1 template/4 pages–Sense/Matter/Space/Future)</li>
      <li>Contributor/Author Page</li>
      <li>Email capture</li>
      <li>404</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition to designs for various page layouts, we’ll also think through:</p>

    <ul class="task-list">
      <li>Interactive states (how the page loads, how things respond to a user’s cursor)</li>
      <li>How the website behaves on various screen sizes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We will provide the following, as necessary:</p>

    <ul class="task-list">
      <li>static comps of layouts for the above pages, states, scenarios</li>
      <li>prototypes (click-through or animated)</li>
      <li>asset templates</li>
      <li>interactive states</li>
      <li>styles, documentation, annotation for development</li>
    </ul>

      Content Entry</h3>

    <p>We think of this phase in three parts:</p>

    <ul class="task-list">
      <li>Direction – Are the assets you’re using tell the story you want to tell? Will they work with the new designs?</li>
      <li>Creation – Will we want to or need to make anything new for the website?</li>
      <li>Content entry – A large of amount of the content will most likely be able to be migrated from the current site. (This is everything from editorial content to product info to sales data.) However, there might be some new content that needs to be
        entered manually. Who will do that?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At the minimum, we will need to enter some copy for interface elements and clean-up migrated content.</p>

    <p>During the development phase, we will share staging URLs and CMS access. We’ll provide structure for submitting feedback for 2 rounds of testing.</p>

    <p>We will be delivering:</p>

    <ul class="task-list">
      <li>Fully functioning website reflecting approved designs</li>
      <li>Github repo with website codebase</li>
      <li>CMS to host and update editable website content</li>
      <li>Best practices for modern web development standards and technologies, SEO, AA-level accessibility, Social Graph metadata, etc.</li>
      <li>Documentation for how the codebase is set up (via Github) and any guidelines for using the CMS (as necessary).</li>
      <li>Integrations for any third-party services (e.g. analytics) or software (e.g. webfonts) as per scope</li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="task-list">
      <li>Do you want to do any kind of user testing at any point in the project?</li>
      <li>Who are the key stakeholders in the project? Which milestones should they be included in the process?</li>
      <li>This scope assumes we will be able to migrate existing content to the CMS and requiring only minimal formatting updates.</li>
      <li>Will there be new articles made specifically for launch?</li>
      <li>Search is not included but there will be a way to create category-based landing pages</li>
      <li>Are there any special plugins, support, tracking, or analytics tools you want to use?</li>
      <li>We do not update design files with final copy. If you provide final copy prior to the final design review we will incorporate it into designs, otherwise we will use near-real placeholder copy and final copy will go directly into code/CMS.</li>
      <li>Where would you like to store email sign-ups? We like Mailchimp.</li>
